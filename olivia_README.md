To generate the diagrams (no question) run the following:
build_formulas.py
output3_fixer.py
try_these.py
tester.py (uses tester.txt with just the questions (tree format)) -> modified_output.txt

To generate the questions:
build_questions2.py (outputs to tester2.txt)
- it has diagrams + question
try_these.py -> tester3_full.txt
tester.py
